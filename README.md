# gitShare

gitShare is a small but efficient Chrome extension, that allows to share any github project directly on Twitter.
It will probably never be on the Chrome Store, just because. 

### Install
- Clone this repo
- Go to `chrome://extensions/`
- If it's not already done, check the checkbox "Developer mode"
- Click on "Load unpacked extension"
- Open the the `gitShare` folder
- And it's done ! 


### Now what ? 
Now just browse github, and each time you'll be in a github repository, you will see this new "Share" button !
