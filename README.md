gitShare is a small but efficient Chrome extension, that allows to share any github project directly on Twitter.
It will probably never be on the Chrome Store, just [because*](#help).

## Install
- Clone this repo or grab the last [release](https://github.com/LukyVj/gitShare/releases/tag/1.3)
- Go to `chrome://extensions/`
- If it's not already done, check the checkbox "Developer mode"
- Click on "Load unpacked extension"
- Open the the `gitShare` folder
- And it's done !


## Now what ?
Now just browse github, and each time you'll be in a github repository, you will see this new "Share" button !

here is the share button : ![](http://puu.sh/kZshn/783d646bd9.png)

## How to actually share ?
I did a video to show you how it works :

## Final words
This extenstion exists because : __Sharing is caring__.

And as web-people, we should support projects that we do like / use.

## Help
Because I don't want to have to design an icon for it, neither all the requirements asked by google. So I will just leave this here.
