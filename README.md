gitShare is a small but efficient Chrome extension, that allows to share any github project directly on Twitter or Facebook.

## Install
- Clone this repo or grab the last [release](https://github.com/LukyVj/gitShare/releases/tag/1.4)
- Go to `chrome://extensions/`
- If it's not already done, check the checkbox "Developer mode"
- Click on "Load unpacked extension"
- Open the the `gitShare/extension` folder
- And it's done !


## Now what ?
Now just browse github, and each time you'll be in a github repository, you will see this new "Share" button !

The share buttons looks like this :

## How to actually share ?
I did a video to show you how it works :

## Final words
This extenstion exists because : __Sharing is caring__.

And as web-people, we should support projects that we do like / use.

## Help
I'm a huge fan of open source projects, communities and team work, that's why I encourage you to [fork](https://github.com/LukyVj/gitShare#fork-destination-box) this project, and improve it or make it for an other browser.

## The extension for everyone

- [@JohJakob](https://github.com/JohJakob) created a [Safari version](https://github.com/JohJakob/gitShare-Safari) of the extension.

You can find different versions of the logo on the `assets/` folder.
